# Summary 
In this project, I sourced an NYC real estate dataset containing various property demographic variables and trained multiple models to predict property prices. The aim is to enable users to input details about their desired property (such as property type, number of bedrooms and bathrooms, location, etc.) and receive a predicted price for purchasing that property.

Due to the initial dataset's limited sample size, I incorporated an additional dataset containing zipcode information. This addition allowed for more accurate location-based predictions.
